# FireBox Setup

## Setup
Setting up FireBox is easy! Supply the board with a 12-24V DC power supply ([like this one](https://amzn.to/37wyNNX)), plug in your main track and programming tracks, and connect the USB port to your computer. That's it! FireBox ships with DCC firmware pre-loaded, so you can open up JMRI on your computer and start running trains right away.

## Software Updates
Upgrading software to the latest version is simple - just use the [DCC++ EX installer](../../start/installer-setup.md)
